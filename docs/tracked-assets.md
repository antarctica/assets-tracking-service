# BAS Assets Tracking Service - Tracked Assets

## BAS aircraft

BAS aircraft, including the Dash 7 (x1) and Twin Otters (x4) are tracked using the
[Aircraft Tracking](./providers.md#aircraft-tracking) provider.

**Note:** Details about this provider are confidential and so restricted.

## BAS ships

### RRS SDA

The [Royal Research Ship - Sir David Attenborough](https://www.bas.ac.uk/sda) (RRS SDA), the primary logistics and
science vessel used by BAS is tracked using the [Geotab](./providers.md#geotab) provider.
